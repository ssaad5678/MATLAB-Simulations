# Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in MATLAB

## Overview

This MATLAB program demonstrates the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to analyze the frequency components of a signal. The program generates a sample signal containing two sinusoids of different frequencies, corrupts it with random noise, and then applies FFT to obtain the frequency spectrum of the signal.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing `fft_demo.m`.
3. Run the script `Fast Fourier Transform.m`.
4. The program will generate a plot showing the original signal in the time domain and its corresponding frequency spectrum.

## Program Details

The program follows these steps:

1. Define a sample signal containing two sinusoids of different frequencies.
2. Add random noise to the signal to simulate a real-world scenario.
3. Plot the signal in the time domain to visualize its waveform.
4. Compute the FFT of the signal to obtain its frequency spectrum.
5. Plot the single-sided amplitude spectrum of the signal in the frequency domain.
