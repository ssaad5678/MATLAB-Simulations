# Linear Regression in MATLAB

## Overview

This MATLAB program demonstrates linear regression on a synthetic dataset. It generates a synthetic dataset with a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable, then performs linear regression using the normal equations to estimate the parameters (coefficients) of the linear regression model. Finally, it plots the synthetic dataset along with the linear regression line to visualize the relationship between the input features and the output variable.

## Contents

- `linear_regression.m`: MATLAB script containing the linear regression program.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the program.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing `linear_regression.m`.
3. Run the script `linear_regression.m`.
4. The program will generate a synthetic dataset, perform linear regression, and plot the dataset along with the linear regression line.

## Program Details

The program follows these steps:

1. Generate a synthetic dataset with random input features and a linear relationship with the output variable.
2. Perform linear regression using the normal equations to estimate the parameters (coefficients) of the linear regression model.
3. Plot the synthetic dataset along with the linear regression line to visualize the relationship between the input features and the output variable.
